    p "Preliminary autopsy puts the time of death between 6 PM yesterday and 12 AM today."
    p "Cause of death is currently unknown, but we have ruled out the hook."
    p "Based on the lack of blood near the body, it seems that the hook was attached post mortem, some time after the murder."
    p "The blood here is not blood. It is actually just red paint."
    p "The murderer painted it with a wide brush that we found in a trash can nearby. Of course, no fingerprints were found on the brush nor the hook."
    p "The murderer seems to have been wearing gloves during the entire setup."
    c "No sign of a murder weapon?"
    p "Not that we could find, no. We don't even know what we are looking for to be honest with you."
    p "We did notice that there were no signs of a struggle, which seems to point to the possibility that he was unconscious as he was murdered."
    p "We do not know how yet, but a definitive autopsy should clear that up."

    show Crystal confused at left

    show Parker angry at right

    p "It's Parker!"

    # c "Yeah, yeah. We both know Kieran is a big baby."
